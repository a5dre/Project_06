# Project 06

Sumbission for Project 06

## Implementation

I really enjoyed this class. I learned more than I could imagine over the course of the semester from a class that wasn't required to my major.
I wish I could have included more effort into Project 06, but with finals and the end of the semester came much more than I could have anticipated.
Have a wonderful summer and I hope you enjoy some relaxing time with your family!
